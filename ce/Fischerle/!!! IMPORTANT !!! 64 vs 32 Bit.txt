
			64 vs. 32 Bit


Fischerle is a chess engine designed for 64 bit environments.

The core of Fischerle is constituted by an efficient implementation
of the rotated bitboard model for chess position representation.
Thus, Fischerle is highly recommended to be employed on 64 bit
systems (NB: operating system AND Java Runtime Environment!), since
this greatly enhances the performance of bitboard-based computations.

Running Java-based Fischerle on 32 bit systems is of course possible,
but performance will decline considerably.

IMPORTANT: PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE EMPLOYING THE .exe OR .bat
STARTER that fits your particular environment (i. e., 64 or 32 bit),
since the numbers of hash table entries to be assigned depend upon
whether you are running Fischerle on a 64 bit or 32 bit system.
That is, on 32 bit systems, hash table cardinalities can be somewhat
larger, since the memory footprints of the hash table entries are
smaller.

For full details, see document "README 0_9_70_SE_64_or_32.txt",
section "Hash Table Sizes".
